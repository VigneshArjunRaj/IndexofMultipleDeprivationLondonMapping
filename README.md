## Project Overview

The **Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)** is a vital tool for understanding inequalities in different aspects of life across regions. This project focuses specifically on London and aims to visualize these disparities through maps, charts, and widgets. By providing insights into educational, health, crime, income, employment, and living environment-related deprivation, the project aims to empower policymakers, researchers, and citizens with valuable information.

## Data Source

The project relies on data sourced from the [CARTO](https://carto.com/) platform. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deprivation scores for different areas within London. These scores are calculated by aggregating various indicators from multiple domains, allowing for a holistic assessment of deprivation.

## Deprivation Domains

The project covers the following deprivation domains:

- **Educational Deprivation**: Reflects the educational opportunities and access to learning resources in different regions.
- **Health Deprivation and Disability**: Explores the state of health services, wellness, and access to healthcare facilities.
- **Level of Crime**: Highlights crime rates and safety concerns in various neighborhoods.
- **Income Deprivation Affecting Children**: Focuses on child poverty and economic inequalities affecting the younger population.
- **Employment**: Examines employment opportunities and economic stability across regions.
- **Living Environment**: Evaluates the quality of the physical environment and living conditions.

## Web Page
